title:  "Hackback2 Results"
---
As some of you know we competed in [hackback](https://tryhackme.com/hackback2) - an inter uni CTF - yesterday, we entered 4 teams with most students competing in a CTF for the first time!

To say we are proud of everyone who turned up would be an understatement, you should all be proud of the performances you put in!

A special mention goes to Meg - our new Events and Sponsorship Officer - who competed for the whole day on her own despite it being her first CTF!

Another mention goes to one of our teams, BeEFBurger, who managed to finish 9th out of over 200 teams despite being a man down due to illness!

This was our best performance in a CTF ever - even beating the committee team at the last hackback who came 13th out of 73 teams!

We'd also like to say a massive thank you to the organisers, Ben and Ashu, for running the event - we loved it and can't wait for the next one!
